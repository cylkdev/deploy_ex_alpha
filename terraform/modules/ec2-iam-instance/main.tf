#
# An IAM role is a virtual identity that grants access to AWS
# resources. The role itself doesnâ€™t define permissions and
# relies on IAM policies to define its behavior. These roles
# are required to obtain temporary security credentials via
# the metadata service.
#
# An instance profile is a container for an IAM role, allowing an
# EC2 instance to assume that role. When an instance profile is
# associated with an IAM role, the EC2 instance automatically
# assumes the role at runtime. Temporary credentials (access key,
# secret key, session token) are securely provided to the
# instance through the metadata service.
#
# The permissions available via temporary credentials are defined
# by IAM policies attached to the role. These permissions dictate
# actions the instance can perform, such as accessing S3 or
# DynamoDB.
#
# Temporary credentials are scoped to the IAM policies of the
# role, ensuring the instance can only execute explicitly
# allowed actions.
#
# IAM policies are like rules specifying allowed or denied
# actions for users, groups, or roles within your AWS account.
#
# Policies tell AWS:
#
#   * Who can access something.
#
#   * What they can do (e.g., read, write, delete).
#
#   * Where they can do it (specific resources like an S3 bucket
#     or EC2 instance).
#
#   * When or how they can do it (optional conditions).
#
# IAM role has the following policies:
#
#   * Trust policy - Define who/what can assume the role.
#
#   * Role policy - Specify actions, accessible resources, and
#     conditions.
